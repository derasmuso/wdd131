            <h2>Moroni 10:4</h2>
            <p>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in
                the name of
                Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having
                faith in
                Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>

            <h2>3 Nephi 17:7</h2>
            <p>Have ye any that are sick among you? Bring them hither. Have ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or
                maimed, or
                leprous, or that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner? Bring them hither
                and I will heal
                them, for I have compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy.</p>
